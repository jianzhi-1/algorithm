# Data Structures

### CP Notes

#### Segment Trees
- vector of segment trees: _vector<node*> v;_

#### Binary Lifting
- static array, jump faster


### Non-CP Notes

#### Binary Search Tree
- Left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- Right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
